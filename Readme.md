# This is on my next to-do list.

### I am going to make a tool that finds lost people in the ocean using object detection algorithms. It's too bad that there is only so much time I can afford on my hobbies.

### The idea is to have airplanes capture photos/video during the flight, and this algorithm will alert the airplane if it detects a floating human on the ocean.

### I plan on distributing it for free to use.
